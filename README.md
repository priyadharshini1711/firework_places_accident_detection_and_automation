## General Information
- This project aims at detection and prevention of accidents at firework places due to high carbon emmision and then automate the alerting process.
- This project is based out of real time problems faced in firework places
- The project is purely soci-environmental, thus reducing the life risks at hazardous places.
- This was take asa part of final year project.


## Technologies Used
- embedded C
- Arduino UNO
- ThinksSpeak


## Features
- This project can be installed at firework plcaes and its non hazardous carbon emission rates can be prefixed.
- This device will then check the deviation and run the analytics backend.
- Once the hazardous level is detected it wil indicate to the administrator and alert the people using buzzers and signals.
- This project comes intact of accident prevention methods
